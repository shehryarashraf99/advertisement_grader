This was a short lived project That I worked on. loop.py was part of an entire project called project Hermes.
The objective is, that we want to generate catchy subjectlines and headers for emails to advertise products to appeal to certain demographics
loop.py takes in demographics data from firebase and generates advertisements that would appeal to it
Another llm is used to grade the advertisement with respect to the demographics information in question.
